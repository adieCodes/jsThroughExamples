# Data Structures

A data structure is a way of storing a collection of values. There are two main types of data structures in JavaScript:

-   Arrays
-   Objects

## Arrays

Arrays are lists of values, defined by surrounding the values in square brackets `[]` with each value separated with a comma.

```
// The array can contain random data types
const randomData = [1, 'adie', false, 2, false, true, 'stuff']
// Although its often the same type
const highScores [123, 12, 299, 503, 86]
```

If you want to access a single value within an array you can use its position in the array wrapped in square brackets, the technical term for its position is its index. There is one thing to remember though... when finding its index you start counting from 0, so the first value would have an index (position) of 0 and the second item would have an index of 1.

```
const firstScore = highScores[0]
// 123
const secondScore = highScores[1]
// 12
```

## Objects

Objects are lists but each item within the list is made up of key/value pairs. With the key being the name of the value, which makes finding the value much easier. A good example of this would be someone's address:

```
const address = {
    houseNumber: 10,
    street: 'Downing Street',
    city: 'London',
}
```

If you wanted to get the city you would use `address.city`, with a dot between the variable and key name. This would return `London` as the value.

## Task

1. Create an array storing the numbers 1-5 in the correct order.
2. The variables from the last lesson make more sense as part of an object, add key value pairs with the same name as the variables in the last lesson.
